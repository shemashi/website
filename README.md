In order to facilitate the registration process for the user, we divided it into three steps and thus we obtained three registration pages: "registration1.php, registration2.php and registration3.php".


• Registration1.php:
                    This first registration page asks the user to enter all his personal information:
-	Her name.
-	His first name.
-	His date of birth.
- His email and a password to connect afterwards.
- His gender.


• Registration2.php:
                    This second registration page asks the user to choose the cycle and the sector he wishes to pursue during his study course at INSEA.
                    
                    
• Registration3.php:
                    This third registration page asks the user to provide photocopy images corresponding to:
- His own personal photo
- CIN national identity card.
- His high school diploma.
- Certificate of achievement.
To go from one page to another, just click on the next button to access it, but if a field is still not filled in, you cannot go to the next page.
Also each time when the page changes, the information of the previous page is saved in the project database.![tty](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57497464/154806524-54c7e811-f470-4899-b8ce-7c5338680d36.png)
